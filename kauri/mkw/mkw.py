"""
The MKW (Munthe-Kaas--Wright) Hopf algebra module.

The MKW Hopf algebra ``H_MKW = (OF, shuffle, Delta_MKW)`` lives on
ordered (planar) forests with the **commutative shuffle product** and
the left-admissible-cuts coproduct.  Characters of ``H_MKW`` satisfy
``alpha(x shuffle y) = alpha(x) * alpha(y)``.  Base exponential
characters are often supplied from tree values and extended with the
shuffle-symmetric ``1/k!`` convention, but composed characters must keep
their actual ordered-forest values.  The :class:`kauri.maps.Map` objects
returned by :func:`counit`, :func:`antipode`, :func:`map_product` and
:func:`map_power` therefore use ``extension="shuffle"`` with basis-aware
functions that can evaluate both trees and ordered forests.
