"""
Utility functions for dealing with generic Hopf algebras on trees.

Two forest-extension conventions coexist here:

* **Concatenation** (``forest_apply``, ``func_product``, ``func_power``) —
  ``alpha(t_1 * ... * t_k) = alpha(t_1) * ... * alpha(t_k)``.  Correct for
  non-commutative algebras (BCK, NCK, CEM, GL, PGL).
* **MKW** (``mkw_apply``, ``mkw_convolution_func``, ``mkw_convolution_power``,
  ``mkw_base_char_func``, ``mkw_shuffle_symmetric_value``) — base characters
  extend to ordered forests via the shuffle-symmetric formula
  ``alpha(t_1, ..., t_k) = prod alpha(t_i) / k!``, while convolution results
  evaluate on forests through the paper's forest coproduct (implemented in
  ``kauri.mkw.forest_coproduct_impl``).  This split is essential for
  associative iterated convolution on the MKW Hopf algebra.
